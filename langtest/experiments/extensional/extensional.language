/*
The challenge here is to represent extensional type theory in this system,
even though I can't in this system influence the way that term equivalence is
computed - it is always just beta-eta-alpha equivalence.

To solve this, I'll need a version of extensional type theory where applications
of a substitution principle are explicit in the syntax.
