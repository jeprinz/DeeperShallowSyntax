/*

This file demonstrates how unification not being completely implemented is
causing issues with checking the dependent language.

There is a leftover constraint that should be able to be resolved.

In general, any equation of the form:
?X t1 t2 ... tn = rhs

Where each ti is of the form:
t ::= x | fst t | snd t

AND any variable which appears multiple times in the ti's isn't free in rhs,

Let xi be the variable at ti.
Then the equation can be eliminated and result in the substitution:

weaken = \t. \gamma. t (fst gamma)
{
    ---------------- ""
    IsId (\x . x)
}
{
    {IsId ?delay},
    ?delay (weaken ?fresh1) == ?delay (\dummy. Type)
    ------------------- "test"
    Top
}

/*
Also, I'm testing if there is a bug with how I implented cases like
?X x = x
*/

{
    {Result ?X},
    \x y. ?X x y == \x y. x
    ------------------------------------- "test2"
