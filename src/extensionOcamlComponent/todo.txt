I should make a new field in the constructor type called "messages", which is another list of terms.
When a message is created, it gets constraint filled like a hiddenConstraint. The only difference is that it
keeps track of the tree made up by the message, and shows it to the user at that location when it is done.

Maybe I should also consider having a way to show raw terms for debugging purposes? 



The main thing I need to figure out how is how to make a language for describing syntax that can capture itself.
I could just have part of it that it processes afterwards, but it would be nice if I didn't need that.




[ ] - Make it not allow regexes to match whitespace no matter what, by finding the first whitespace character and cutting off the match there.
[ ] - Finish filling in specSpec, specifically the "look" part. The look should just consider any tokens without whitespace
    (which requires the previouis TODO to make it possible).
    Also, underscores should be name holes. But somehow it should be possible to also match underscores themselvesls
    ?
